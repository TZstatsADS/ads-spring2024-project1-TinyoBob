### [Project Description](doc/Proj1_desc.md)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Spring 2024

+ Projec title: How marital and emotional status affects people's happiness?
+ This project is conducted by Tianyi Xia

+ Project summary:  
**Background:** Marital status and emotional well-being have significant impacts on an individual's happiness. Previous research has indicated that marital status (such as single, married, divorced, widowed, separated) and emotional status (such as mood, mental health) are intricately linked to one's level of happiness. Understanding these relationships is crucial for promoting happiness and mental well-being. Therefore, this project aims to explore how marital status and emotional states influence people's happiness.  
**Objectives:** The objective of this project is to investigate how individuals describe happiness under different emotional states, thereby understanding the effects of marital status and emotional well-being on happiness. Specific objectives include:
  1. Analyzing subjective descriptions and feelings of happiness among individuals with different marital statuses (single, married, divorced, widowed, separated).
  2. Investigating the interaction effects between marital status and emotional states on individuals' overall happiness.
